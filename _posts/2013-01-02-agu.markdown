subtitle:   "A new Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method code was created to simulate the interaction between Ultralow Velocity Zone patches (ULVZ) and the core-mantle boundary (CMB).  Initial research investigates the interaction between the CMD and ULVZ patches in the presence of a buoyancy force for various viscosities.  The research also examines the ability to keep dense ULVZ patches suspended in a mantle by a driving convection force over geological time.  Future research will combine all forces into one simulation to search for parameters required to keep ULVZ patches geologically stable."

A short video including the simulations is embedded below, as well as a link to the presentation slides from the 2012 AGU Fall Meeting, Abstract DI22A-08.
