I presented the current state of my research in a student poster session during the tenth annual [Burgers Program for Fluid Dynamics](http://www.burgers.umd.edu) at the University of Maryland: College Park.
The poster presented the continued to ability scale my Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method code to handle more particles.  With a grant from [XSEDE](http://www.xsede.org), I have been able to run hundreds of simulations, each containing thousands of particles.  For these specific simulations, we are analyzing the contiguity of a grain matrix when it is exposed to shear stresses.
