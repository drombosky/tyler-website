The Department of Mathematics held their 2013 Spotlight on Student Research talks this past Wednesday and Thursday where I won the Seymour Goldberg Gold Medal for outstanding presentation.  I presented an updated research summary on my Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method code and it's ability to run long simulations involving dozens of particles.
